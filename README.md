# Height and Weight Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project performs clustering on a dataset that includes height and weight data. The primary goal is to group individuals based on their height and weight using K-Means Clustering. The dataset contains two main attributes:
- `Height(Inches)`: Height of individuals in inches
- `Weight(Pounds)`: Weight of individuals in pounds

### Features:
- Load data from a CSV file
- Preprocess and normalize the data
- Apply K-Means clustering algorithm
- Visualize the clusters

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.6+**
2. **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** (for interactive development)
3. **Required Python libraries**:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `scikit-learn`

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VivekkumarChauhan/Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering.git
